I always thought of myself as a mini version of my sister. From going to the same college (UC Davis)  to playing the same sport (basketball baby!), I always wanted to be just like my big sister. Besides Ben, she is the only person that I can truly be my dorky self. From singing and dancing in the car to NSYNC to baking brownies every Monday night while watching the Bachelor, she is truly my twin. She was always there for me whenever I had heartbreak and was always there to give me hope that one day when I least expect it, I would finally meet that special person. Chermaine (aka Shimmey, Shims, Sissy, etc) is one of the smartest, most loving, and selfless people I have ever known. My sister has always put herself before others which is one of the many traits that I admire most about her. Being so selfless, Chermaine actually created this website from scratch ( *mind blown*). I can\'t thank my sister enough for what she\'s done for me. I’m so happy to have my sister stand by my side as my matron of honor for the best day of my life.'

I remember we went spent a day at Disneyland and there was a meet and greet inside Innovations where you could meet Captain America. Addy was hilarious as she posed with Captain America (her face was priceless!) After spending time with her during that trip, I realized how funny Addy is and how similar she is to Ben. Addy is also an amazing Instagrammer (take notes folks). During my trip to Nebraska, I was blessed to attend a church service in the church that Ben grew up going to. Being sneaky, Addy took a picture of Ben and I holding hands during the service. She got us good as we had no idea she took the picture. Addy is funny, confident, and the little sister that I have never had. I’m so glad she gets to stand by my side on my big day and hopefully will capture some candid pics to post on Instagram! '

If only I lived in Nebraska, I would definitely be the first person to sign up to be her official taste tester. I love how she can turn your favorite desserts into healthy desserts so you won’t feel guilty on having another piece. I’m not sure what her secret is but I’m excited to see what receipes she’ll cook up next. Amanda is very nurturing, loving, and passosinate about Christ. Amanda comes as a package deal. She wouldn\'t be complete without her husband Wyatt and her son Wylie. Wylie is the cutest kid ever who everyone gets to meet on our big day as he will be our ring bearer. I\'m so excited to have these two share my big day with me. '

We soon realized that during college football games, you don’t sit down ..at all. From walking a couple of miles to the game to standing for three hours, the walk back home was tough. With Jen by my side, she made the walk home enjoyable and I realized that this girl was going to be more than a roomate but a great friend. Jen was always there to talk to about boys, go dancing with at Tres Hermanas, go to UCD sporting events, and eat crepes at Crepeville (our favorite local spot). Jen is smart, athletic, and one of the most down to earth people you will ever meet. I\'m so blessed to have such a great friend become one of my bridesmaids for the biggest day of my life. '

Monica is another bride-to-be and I was so excited that I could finally talk to someone about wedding plans! Besides being an organized bride like myself, I found out that Monica was an amazing baker! While I was in Nebraska, Monica made these healthy chocolate chip cookies with coconut flour that tasted better than the real thing. It was so good, we ate the whole batch in one night (That’s my kinda girl!) I also witnessed Monica make a couple of items for her wedding. She is so crafty and talented, Martha Stewart better watch her back! Monica is energetic, creative, and super sweet. I’m so excited for this bride to become one of my bridesmaids!'
